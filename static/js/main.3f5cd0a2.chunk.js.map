     Most patients believe that it is their responsibility to organize donors to meet this need.  In other words, the search for blood begins after the need has arisen.  This naturally would put a lot of pressure on the patient.\r\n                        This also compromises on the safety of blood.  It is an established fact that a voluntary blood donor is the safest source of blood as compared to a donor who responds to the need of a specific individual.\r\n                        Ideally the blood units should be present in the Blood Bank before the patient is admitted.  Voluntary blood donation drives at venues convenient to donors can easily ensure that this objective is met.  This is reassuring to the patient, easy for the donor, and, more importantly, ensures availability of safe blood.\r\n                    </Paragraph>\r\n                    <ContentContainer>\r\n\r\n                        <Heading id='blood-facts'>Blood Facts</Heading>\r\n                        <Subheading>History of blood donation</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            <Span>1657:</Span> Dr. Christopher Wren performed experiments of injecting various fluids into the veins of animals.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                            <Span>1665:</Span> First documented demonstration of blood transfusion between two dogs by Richard Lower.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                            <Span>1667:</Span> First attempt at direct human donor to patient blood transfusion by Jean Baptiste Denis in France.

Atleast 15 to 20 ml of blood per kg of body weight is a buffer stock in the human body. This blood is more than what is required for normal circulation in the body.\r\n\r\n                        The total blood collected during blood donations is 350/450 ml. - a very small fraction of the buffer stock of blood in the body. And, even this donated blood is regenerated by the body on its own in a short time. The donor is fit to resume normal duties after an hour of donation.\r\n\r\n                        The blood that is donated is of very little consequence to the donor, but is a matter of life and death for a suffering fellow human being.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Is it painful to donate blood?</Span><br />\r\n                        After the initial prick of the needle, all you feel is a gentle pressure, but no pain.

RBCs have a substance called haemoglobin, which plays the role of carrying the oxygen that we breathe in, to the various tissues of the body. RBCs form almost 45 % of the total blood volume. In most cases, when a person needs blood transfusion, he/she needs RBCs.\r\n\r\n                        RBCs when separated out from donated Blood are called Packed Cells. In the normal conditions existing in Blood Banks, the life of RBCs is 35 days.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                            <span>White Blood Cells</span><br />\r\n                        White Blood Cells are the defence mechanism of the body. Whenever the body is subjected to attack from outside, WBCs swing into action and protect the body. They identify, destroy and remove any foreign material that has entered the body. WBCs form less than 1 % of the total blood volume.\r\n\r\n                        Outside the body, when separated from donated blood, WBCs, in most cases, are of very little use. On the contrary they can be harmful to the receiver. Presence of WBCs increases the risk of adverse transfusion reaction and infection.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Platelets</Span><br />\r\n                        Platelets are cells, which play the role of helping in clotting of blood. Reduction in the Platelet count can lead to bleeding.\r\n\r\n                        Outside the body, when separated out from donated blood, Platelets have a life of 5 days.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                            <span>Plasma</span><br />\r\n                        Plasma is the fluid part of Blood. It enables blood to flow, and plays the role of a carrier. It carries the RBCs, WBCs and Platelets. It also plays the role of carrying nutrients to the various parts of the body, and takes out the waste matter.\r\n\r\n                        When separated from donated Blood, Plasma in frozen condition, called Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) has a life of upto 1 year.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>Who can give blood to whom</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            <Image src={bloodFact} />\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Universal Donor</Span><br />\r\n\r\n                            In the event of an emergency when it is not possible to cross-match, O Rh. Negative blood may be given to the patient. O Rh. Negative is also termed as Universal Donor.\r\n\r\n                            In layman’s terms, O Rh Negative can be termed as that blood which has no Antigen – neither ‘A’ nor ‘B’ nor ‘Rh’. In other words, this blood group has nothing which is foreign to the recipient.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Universal Recepient</Span><br />\r\n\r\n                            Similarly, AB Rh Positive is termed as a Universal Recepient.

Therefore there is nothing foreign for the persons having this blood group. They can receive blood from anybody.\r\n                            Theoretically, Rh Negative can be given to Rh positive of the same A,B,O, group.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Heading id='blood-donation'>Blood Donation</Heading>\r\n                        <Subheading>Types of blood donation</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            <Span>Voluntary Blood Donation:</Span><br />\r\n                            When a person donates blood without expecting anything in return, and without expecting it to be given to any specific person, he/she is called a Voluntary Blood Donor. In most cases such voluntary donors are repeat donors. Statistics show that this is the safest form of donation. Voluntary Blood Donation can be done by donating blood during Blood Donation Drives or by going to a Blood Bank and donating blood without any expectations. This form of Blood Donation ensures that Blood is already present in the Blood Banks and does not wait for a specific emergency.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Directed Blood Donation:</Span><br />\r\n\r\n                            When a person donates blood for a specific patient and expects the donated blood to be given to that specific patient only, he/she is called a Directed Blood Donor. This form of blood donation is crisis-driven and therefore is not encouraged. The donor is donating blood under duress and at the request of a known person, and therefore may not disclose his true medical history. Blood collected in this manner has a higher chance of being unsafe.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Replacement Blood Donation:</Span><br />\r\n\r\n                            When a person donates blood to replace the blood that has already been transfused to a patient, he/she is called a Replacement Blood Donor. This, unfortunately, is used by Hospitals and Blood Banks as a method of ensuring availability of blood. The onus of organizing blood is put on the patient, who may resort to bringing in a commercial donor or bring a friend or relative under duress. In any case, this donation is effectively a commercial donation, because this is done to get a refund on the deposit that the blood bank charges the patient for the blood issued.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Autologous Blood Donation:</Span><br />\r\n\r\n                            Strictly speaking this cannot be called a donation. This is a case of blood being donated for oneself. It is possible for an individual to donate blood, store it and have it used for himself/herself. Of course this is possible for a planned operation, and provided the patient is healthy enough to donate blood. Since one’s own blood is being transfused, there is hardly any risk of transmitting any virus or of any adverse transfusion reaction. All the same, the routine tests and cross-matching formalities are carried out even in this situation. Autologous blood donation becomes even more relevant in cases of rare blood groups, where finding a donor may prove difficult.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            It is a known fact that the blood collected from a voluntary, repeat donor is the safest. Therefore society should aim for 100 % voluntary blood donation.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>Voulantry blood donation drives</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Blood donation is perceived by most people as an act of donating blood for a friend or relative who is in a hospital. Most people believe that by donating blood in a hospital, one can ensure that the donated blood will go to the right person. This perception owes its origins to the practices followed by doctors and hospitals.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Hospitals have propagated this practice to ensure availability of blood. They believe that voluntary blood donors are rare. They also know that the patient has very little choice but to get donors to come to the hospital. The patient is almost made to believe that the surgery or treatment will not take place unless the donors are organized by the patient. The onus of organizing blood has been shifted by the hospital on to the patient, who is made to feel guilty for not organizing blood.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            This practice is inhuman towards the suffering patient. It is the most inefficient way of collecting blood. It does not recognize the selflessness of the donor. And, most importantly, it compromises on the safety of blood. Therefore, contrary to the perception created by the hospital, bringing a donor to a hospital for a specific patient increases the risk of unsafe blood.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Voluntary blood donors exist. It is necessary for Blood Banks to go to where the donors are. If information is given to the donor about blood donation, and if blood donation is made convenient, donors will come and donate blood voluntarily. It is important to identify places where voluntary blood donation drives can be held.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            The segments where blood donation drives can be held are:\r\n\r\n                            Colleges,\r\n                            Offices,\r\n                            Factories,\r\n                            Residential areas,\r\n                            Religious Institutions/Congregations,\r\n                            Railway stations (with airconditioned structures), <br /><br />\r\n                            It is our experience that large number of donors turn up for blood donation drives.

Needless to say, the chosen blood bank will be one that is approved by the authorities. You could choose the Blood Bank of your choice after keeping in mind that the expected number of donors is in line with the requirement of the blood bank. See the Section on ‘Choosing the Blood Bank’.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Duration of the Drive</Span><br />\r\n                            Convenience to the donor is the most important criterion here.

While we all agree that blood donation is purely voluntary, one cannot just sit back after making an announcement about the drive. Some people have misconceptions and apprehensions about blood donation, which have to be dispelled. Others need to be given a reminder about the Drive. Remember that every additional donor means an additional life saved.\r\n                            See the Section on ‘Motivating Potential Donors’ in the pages that follow.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Physical arrangements</Span><br />\r\n                            See the Section on ‘Physical arrangements’ in the pages that follow.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>Choosing the venue</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            The venue of the Drive could be a classroom in a school, a community hall, a residential society office room, the stilt area in a building, conference room in an office, canteen in an office, any three rooms in an office etc.\r\n                            <br /> <br />\r\n                            The following factors should help in deciding the venue:\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Proximity to the potential donors</Span><br />\r\n                            This is a very important factor. Donors who are fence sitters may end up not donating blood, and justify their action on the grounds of distance of the venue.<br />\r\n                            <br /><Span>Physical dimensions of the venue</Span><br />\r\n                            The venue should be large enough to provide for the size of the Blood Donation Drive. The size of the Blood Donation Drive will determine the area required for filling up of forms and registration, the area required for the number of beds and the area required for refreshments and post donation activity.<br />\r\n                            <br /><Span>Availability of facilities</Span><br />\r\n                            The venue should have the following facilities:<br />\r\n                            a.

This requires personal attention, and an effort to get as many people as possible to be part of the organizing team.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        The various means of communicating with potential donors are listed below. You could try some or all of them, depending on applicability to your situation.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Leaflets</Span><br />\r\n                        This is particularly applicable to drives being organized at residential areas. The leaflets should contain information about why, when and where the Blood donation drive is being held. Ideally, the leaflet should be distributed 3 to 4 days before the day of the Drive.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Press Release</Span><br />\r\n                        This is a very easy way of communicating to a large audience. This not only serves the purpose of communicating to potential donors, but also provides motivation to the members of the organizing committee. A simple press release issued to the “Chief Reporter’ of the various newspapers is all it takes. The Press release may be faxed to the relevant newspapers 3-4 days before the Day of the Drive.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Scroll on television</Span><br />\r\n                        The local cable channels may be requested to a carry a scroll announcing the Blood Donation Drive. The cable channels may be requested to carry the scroll for 2 to 3 days leading to the drive and on the day of the Drive.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Posters</Span><br />\r\n                        Standard Posters are available with the Blood Banks, who can be asked to send the same to the organizers. These can be displayed at strategic places for a week before the Drive.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Banners</Span><br />\r\n                        Banners announcing the drive may be put up at prominent places. The banners could be put up a week before the Drive.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Lectures</Span><br />\r\n                        Lectures are one of the most effective ways of communicating and convincing potential donors to come and donate blood. A personal appeal is very important, and has the advantage of having the undivided attention of the target segment. The difficult part is to get the people to attend the lecture. Places of worship, clubs and other places where people normally congregate are ideal venues for having lectures.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Person to person</Span><br />\r\n                        By far the most effective and laborious method is to go door-to-door in a residential area and person-to-person in an office area. A large number of committed volunteers are required for this purpose. A key person known to the target audience should accompany the team going door to door.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Screen-saver/Desktop</Span><br />\r\n                        All computers in the office can carry a Screen-saver carrying the message of blood donation, on the day of the Drive and a day prior. Ideally this screen saver should be a simple message from the Chief Executive.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Public-address system</Span><br />\r\n                        Public address system, if available, could be used on the day of the Drive at intervals of 3 hours to announce the Drive. This could also be done by broadcasts through e-mail.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Heads of Depts.</Span><br />\r\n                        Heads of departments should be asked to talk to employees in their department.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Core Group</Span><br />\r\n                        A Core Group should be appointed and assigned responsibility for making the Drive a success. The main role to be played by the Core Group is to reach out to as many people as possible on a ‘one-to-one’ basis. Word of mouth is most important, particularly on the day of the Drive.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Targets to volunteers</Span><br />\r\n                        The members of the managing committee should fix targets for themselves. Each managing committee member or departmental head in an office should be asked for his commitment of blood donors.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <Span>Circular to employees</Span><br />\r\n                        For drives in office areas, Circulars may be sent to all the employees giving them information about the Blood Donation Drive. This will substitute Leaflets, which we suggested should be given to residential areas.\r\n                    </Paragraph>\r\n                </ContentContainer>\r\n            </MainContainer>\r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default BloodKnowledge\r\n\r\nconst Image = styled.img`\r\n    width:600px;\r\n    border:2px solid maroon;\r\n    @media screen and (max-width:700px)\r\n    {\r\n        width:500px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @media screen and (max-width:600px)\r\n    {\r\n        width:90vw;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`\r\nconst MainContainer = styled.div`\r\n    padding-top:20px;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst HeadingContainer = styled.div`\r\n    display:flex;\r\n    justify-content:center;\r\n    padding:20px;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst Heading = styled.h1`\r\n    font-size:64px;\r\n    color:maroon;\r\n    padding-bottom:20px;\r\n    padding-top:80px;\r\n    text-align:center;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst NavigationContainer = styled.div`\r\n    display:flex;\r\n    flex-wrap:wrap;\r\n    justify-content:center;\r\n    padding-bottom:50px;\r\n    border-bottom:0.5px dotted maroon;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst ButtonElement = styled(Link)`\r\n    text-decoration:none;\r\n    margin:5px;\r\n    padding:5px;\r\n    border-radius:3px;\r\n    color:maroon;\r\n    border:1px solid maroon;\r\n    transition:background-color 0.2s;\r\n    &:hover{\r\n        color:whitesmoke;\r\n        background-color:maroon;\r\n        transition:background-color 0.4s;\r\n    }\r\n`\r\nconst ContentContainer = styled.div`\r\n    display:flex;\r\n    flex-direction:column;\r\n    align-items:center;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst Paragraph = styled.p`\r\n    max-width:700px;\r\n    padding:20px;\r\n    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\r\n    font-size:18px;\r\n    text-align:justify;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst Subheading = styled.h3`\r\n    font-size:24px;\r\n    color:maroon;\r\n    text-align:center;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst Span = styled.span`\r\n    font-weight:bold;\r\n    color:black;\r\n`","import React from 'react'\r\nimport styled from 'styled-components';\r\nimport { HashLink as Link } from 'react-router-hash-link';\r\nconst BloodKnowledge = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <>\r\n            <MainContainer id='landing'>\r\n                <HeadingContainer>\r\n                    <Heading>Platelet Donation</Heading>\r\n                </HeadingContainer>\r\n                <NavigationContainer>\r\n                    <ButtonElement to='/platelet-donation#platelet-facts'>Platelets Facts</ButtonElement>\r\n                    <ButtonElement to='/platelet-donation#random-donor-platelet'>Random Donor Platelet</ButtonElement>\r\n                    <ButtonElement to='/platelet-donation#single-donor-platelet'>Single Donor Platelet</ButtonElement>\r\n                    <ButtonElement to='/platelet-donation#need-platelet'>Need Platelets</ButtonElement>\r\n                </NavigationContainer>\r\n                <ContentContainer>\r\n                    <Paragraph>\r\n                        The blood that is collected during a routine blood donation drive is called 'Whole Blood'.

This in most cases is not enough to meet the requirement of one patient. It becomes necessary to collect blood from many donors and consolidate the Platelets obtained from each donor. Therefore, Platelets obtained from Whole Blood in routine blood donations are called Random Donor Platelets (RDPs). They are also called as \"Pooled Platelets\".\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            All Blood Banks in Mumbai do not have the facility of component separation. These Blood Banks collect 'Whole Blood' during blood drives, and these are collected in ‘single’ blood bags. There is no chance of Random Donor Platelets being available with such blood banks.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Blood Banks that are attached to Hospitals primarily try and cater to the in-house requirements. Therefore the Blood Bank staff after making a careful assessment of the in-house requirement of Random Donor Platelets, may decide on not making components from all the units collected during a blood drive.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Since Platelets have a life of only 5 days, making Random Donor Platelets available calls for intensive management, which includes scheduling of large number of smaller drives, and better networking between Blood Banks.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Heading id='single-donor-platelet'>Single Donor Platelet</Heading>\r\n                        <Subheading>What is single donor platelet</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            It is possible to obtain only Platelets from a Donor by a process called ‘Apheresis’. Like in routine blood donation, 350 ml. of blood is drawn from the donor. This is sent to a special Blood Bag, which is housed inside the Apheresis Machine. The machine spins, separates the Platelets and sends the remaining blood components back to the donor’s body. This cycle is repeated 6 – 8 times and the whole process will take approx 60 to 90 minutes. Almost 300 ml. of Platelets is obtained in this manner from just one donor. The Platelets so collected are called Single Donor Platelets (SDP).\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>Advantage of single donor platelet over random donor platelet</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Single Donor Platelets are more potent than Random Donor Platelets. 1 unit of Single Donor Platelets is equivalent to 6-8 units of Random Donor Platelets. Single Donor Platelets, being collected by a more efficient system of component separation, have a lesser chance of carrying other components like RBCs. They therefore become available to be transfused to a patient with any blood group. Considering that the life of Platelets is only 5 days, Single Donor Platelets ensure that there is no wastage, as they are collected against specific needs.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>Blood donation VS apheresis platelet donation</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            In Blood Donation, the donor donates 350/450 ml. of whole blood including RBCs, whereas in Platelet Donation the donor donates approx. 300 ml. of only Platelets.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            There is a temporary drop in the Haemoglobin Count in the case of Blood Donation.

In the case of Platelet Donation, the donor loses only Platelets, which are primarily required in the event of a rupture of a blood vessel.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Unlike Blood Donation, the Apheresis Donor does not have any restrictions with respect to lifting heavy weights and rigorous physical exercises on the day of donation.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            A Blood Donor cannot donate blood again for the next 3 months in India, whereas a Platelet Apheresis Donor can donate blood after 3 days in the event of an emergency.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            The act of blood donation is completed in 3 to 10 minutes, whereas Platelet Apheresis Donation will take between 60 to 90 minutes.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>Availability of platelets</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Platelets that are available in Blood Banks are Random Donor Platelets. This will depend on the number of routine blood donations and the capability and intention of the Blood Bank for component separation. Single Donor Platelets depend on an Apheresis Donor, who normally comes against a specific need. Single Donor Platelets will not be available off the shelf of a Blood Bank.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Platelets have a life of only 5 days. Collecting a lot of Platelets may amount to wasting those which have not been used in 5 days. Blood Banks in India, which are mostly hospital-based, normally make an estimate of the likely off-take of Platelets and carries out separation of Platelets to that extent, during routine Blood Donation Drives. This also ensures saving on the extra cost of triple blood bags used for this purpose, as against single blood bag for ‘Whole Blood’.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Heading id='need-platelet'>Need Platelets</Heading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            If you need Platelets, you could be either looking for RDP (Random Donor Platelets) or SDP (Single Donor Platelets).

Detection of Thalassaemia Major normally occurs when the children are between 3 and 6 months of age.  The disorder is characterized by the inability to produce appropriate haemoglobin.  As a result, delivery of oxygen cannot be effected to the different tissues and cells of the body.  The children are dependent on lifelong blood transfusions.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        Repeated blood transfusions result in an undesirable build up of iron, which can prove fatal.  The children are required to take either injections or medicines daily to dispose off the excess iron (iron chelation).  They are also required to be monitored periodically for other complications.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        Day Care Centers play a very important role in monitoring the children.

This of course is a lifelong treatment.  The only permanent cure available today is a Stem Cell Transplant, for which an HLA matched donor is required.\r\n                    </Paragraph>\r\n                    <ContentContainer>\r\n\r\n                        <Heading id='thal-facts'>Thal Facts</Heading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Thalassaemia Major has existed in the world for hundreds of years. Dr. Thomas Cooley and Dr. Pearl Lee recognized it as a clinical entity only in 1925. Dr. Cooley and Dr. Lee described five cases of Thalassaemia Major, giving details of the condition, its causes and its effects. Being the first to detect the disorder as a form of anaemia, it came to be called as Cooley’s Anaemia.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            It was found that this condition existed in large numbers in the areas bordering the Mediterranean Sea - a belt starting from Italy to Greece to Cyprus to Turkey - and then into Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and India. ‘Thalas’ means ‘the sea’ in Greek and therefore ‘Thalassaemia’ meant ‘anaemia found near the sea’.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Thalassaemia is the term that is widely used all over the world. But to give the historical perspective of its detection and geographical perspective of its prevalence, it is also referred sometimes as ‘Cooley’s Anaemia’ or ‘Mediterranean Anaemia’.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>...is a blood disorder</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Blood is made up of the following components:\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Red Blood Cells<br />\r\n                            Red Blood Cells (RBCs) give the red colour to blood. RBCs have a substance called haemoglobin, which plays the role of carrying the oxygen that we breathe in, to the various tissues of the body.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            White Blood Cells<br />\r\n                            White Blood Cells are the defense mechanism of the body. Whenever the body is subjected to attacks from outside, WBCs swing into action and protect the body.

It also plays the role of carrying nutrients to the various parts of the body, and takes out the waste matter.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Thalassaemia Major is a disorder, which affects the Red Blood Cells in the Blood. The RBCs are full of haemoglobin, which carry the oxygen that we breathe, to the various tissues of the body. Haemoglobin is made up of ‘haem’ (iron component) and ‘globin’ (protein component). Two Alpha and two Beta chains form globin.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            In the case of Thalassaemia Major, there is a reduction in the number of Beta Chains. This leads to improper globin synthesis, and lack of haemoglobin, leading to premature destruction of the RBCs. The child will not be able to carry oxygen to the various tissues of the body. This will prove fatal to the child unless it is monitored and treated properly.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>...is a genetic disorder</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Every physical characteristic and function of the human body is controlled by a pair of genes. Genes are present in every cell of our body. You have two of every kind of gene, one passed on by your mother, the other passed on by your father. One of these two genes tends to dominate and the other is recessive. The characteristic/function acquired by a person depends on which parent’s gene dominates. There could be some characteristic where the mother’s gene dominates, whereas in other characteristics the father’s gene may. Among many other pairs of genes, you have two genes that control how haemoglobin is made in each of your red blood cells.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            ‘Normal’ people are normal because they have two normal genes for haemoglobin. In other words, both parents have passed on normal genes for haemoglobin.<br /><br />\r\n                            Persons with Thalassaemia Minor (also called ‘carriers’) have one normal gene and one altered gene for haemoglobin. They are healthy because the normal gene becomes the dominant gene. One of the parents has passed on the altered gene. Therefore, atleast one parent is definitely a Thalassaemia Minor.<br /><br />\r\n                            People with Thalassaemia Major have two altered genes for haemoglobin. This means that both parents have passed on the altered gene. Therefore both parents have to be ‘carriers’.<br /><br />\r\n                            If both partners in a marriage are Thalassaemia Minor, there are the following possibilities:\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>1. </Span>Both mother and father pass on the normal gene – child is ‘normal’.<br />\r\n                            <Span>2. </Span>Mother passes on the normal gene and father passes on the altered gene – child is a ‘carrier’.<br />\r\n                            <Span>3. </Span>Mother passes on the altered gene and father passes on the normal gene – child is a ‘carrier’.<br />\r\n                            <Span>4. </Span>Both mother and father pass on the altered gene – child is Thalassaemia major (serious problem).<br /><br />\r\n                            Thus a Thalassaemia Major child is born only if both the mother and the father are Thalassaemia Minor.<br />\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>causes of altered gene</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Researchers have been able to identify the pair of altered genes, which cause a reduction in Beta Chains, leading to Thalassaemia Major. These genes are located on chromosome No. 11. Though it is difficult to pin-point the causes, it is clear that the genes underwent a mutation gradually over a few generations.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            When one looks at the regions of the world that have a high incidence of Thalassaemia, one can see that these are the same areas that have had a problem of malaria. It is therefore being hypothesized that due to successive generations being subjected to malaria, the gene has undergone a mutation due to successive generations being subjected to malaria. This hypothesis has gained ground also because of the fact that people carrying the altered gene are known to have a lesser risk against malaria.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            In short, many successive generations of the population being subjected to malaria has resulted in a genetic mutation. The ‘altered’ gene now gives improper instruction leading to a reduction in ‘beta’ chains resulting in improper synthesis of ‘globin’. The consequent lack of haemoglobin results in premature destruction of Red Blood Cells, leading to inability to deliver oxygen to the various tissues of the body.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Heading id='diagnosis'>Diagnosis</Heading>\r\n                        <Subheading>Detection of Thallasaemia Major</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Thalassaemia Major children remain normal till the first  4 to 6 months of life. They start looking pale between the ages of 6 months to 18 months. In a typical situation, when this happens, they are taken to the doctor by the parents. The Doctor after advising a Blood Test, notices a drop in the haemoglobin count.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            In the normal course ‘foetal haemoglobin’ is produced during the foetal stage, which enables delivery of oxygen to the various tissues and cells of the body. This foetal hemoglobin starts to deplete after birth and simultaneously ‘adult haemoglobin’ is produced. The foetal haemoglobin depletes completely between 4 to 6 months of age, at which stage ‘adult haemoglobin’ takes over the role of delivery of oxygen.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            In the case of Thalassaemia Major children ‘adult haemoglobin’ does not get produced. Therefore, after depletion of foetal haemoglobin, delivery of oxygen does not take place. As a result, children begin to look pale, and are low on energy.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Blood tests carried out on High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) machine can detect Thalassaemia Major. This can also be established by DNA tests. A further confirmation can be carried out by checking and establishing that both the parents are Thalassaemia Minor.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>If not treated</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Red Blood Cells are produced in the bone marrow. Unfortunately, in the case of a Thalassaemia Major, the RBCs that are produced die prematurely. The bone marrow realizes that there are no RBCs, and starts producing more RBCs, all of which die prematurely again. This cycle continues even more furiously, resulting in a bone marrow, which is hyperactive.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            The Spleen plays the role of removing the dead blood cells. The continuous stream of dead RBCs activates the Spleen on a continuous basis. The Spleen, as a result, becomes hyperactive resulting in its enlargement. In this situation, the children will need an increased level of transfusion.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            The children do not grow well, look very pale and become irritable and lethargic. Gradually they show various other signs and symptoms like enlargement of spleen, liver; and prominence of bones particularly the skull bones, causing ‘frontal bossing’ (prominence of anterior bone of the skull, ‘parietal bossing’ (prominence of lateral bone of the skull) and ‘occipital bossing’ (prominence of bones on the back of the skull). There may also be prominence of bones of the cheeks and of the upper jaw, leading to protrusion and malocclusion of the teeth. Children with Thalassaemia major, if left untreated, succumb to the disease by the 3rd to 4th year of life.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>Conventional treatment</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            The conventional treatment for Thalassaemia Major does not change the genetic status of the patient.

The conventional treatment comprises of: blood transfusion & iron chelation.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Heading id='transfusion-therapy'>Transfusion Therapy</Heading>\r\n                        <Subheading>\r\n                            Why should blood be transfused?\r\n                        </Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Children living with Thalassaemia Major due to premature destruction of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) are not able to deliver oxygen to the different tissues and cells of the body. This very obviously will have fatal consequences. Blood transfusions, which will ensure that the children receive RBCs, therefore form the mainstay of treatment of Thalassaemia Major.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>What should be transfused?</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Since the children need RBCs, ideally Whole Blood should not be given. The children need to be transfused with RBCs, also called as ‘Packed Cells’, after cross-matching. The Packed Cells if saline-washed will minimize transfusion reactions. In summary, ideally saline-washed Packed Cells should be transfused. For further precaution depletion of leukocytes can be done by using either bedside filters or pre-storage filtration.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>How much & how often to transfuse?</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            The quantity of Packed Cells to be transfused will depend upon the weight of the patient, Hb level of the patient, desired Hb level after transfusion and Haematocrit of the Packed Cells being transfused. As a Thumb Rule, the dosage is usually 10-15 ml/kg of patient’s body weight. In the case of anaemic patients (Hb less than 5 gm/dl) and patients with cardiac problems, the dosage of Packed Cells does not exceed 5 ml/kg of patient’ body weight.<br /><br />\r\n                            Transfusion therapy should commence immediately after confirmation of the diagnosis of Thalassaemia Major. In most cases, the first transfusion is given when the Hb level drops below 7 gm/dl. Thereafter it is necessary to decide on a transfusion regimen. In recent times, there is a school of thought which talks about maintaining a very high Hb level. A super-transfusion regimen advocates a pre-transfusion Hb 11gm/dl with a mean Hb of about 14gm/dl. A hyper-transfusion regimen aims at at pre-transfusion Hb  10gm/dl with a mean of about 12gm/dl. A moderate transfusion regimen tries to maintain the pre-transfusion Hb in the range of 9-10 gm/dl. Most Centres in India adopt the moderate transfusion regimen, which they believe leads to better control of iron overloading. Having decided on the transfusion regimen, the frequency of transfusions can be decided by monitoring the pre-transfusion Hb. The time taken for the Hb level to drop down to the desired pre-transfusion level should be figured. The frequency will vary from patient to patient, and will increase with the age/weight of the child.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>Complications of transfusion</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Apart from the problem of iron overload, complication of repeated blood transfusions include non-haemolytic febrile reactions, alloimmunization and transfusion transmitted infections like HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and Malaria.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Non-haemolytic transfusion reaction and alloimmunization can be prevented by leucoreduction at the prestorage stage (when the components are separated). However, most countries are not able to meet the huge costs of prestorage leucoreduction. The option of using bedside filters is available to the patient.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Heading id='chelation-therapy'>Chelation Therapy</Heading>\r\n                        <Subheading>\r\n                            What is iron overload\r\n                        </Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Packed Cells that are transfused to the patient contain Haemoglobin, which contain iron. Repeated blood transfusion result in more and more iron being deposited in the blood stream. Beyond a point this iron becomes undesirable, and gets deposited in the heart, pancreas, liver, spleen, pituitary glands, thyroid and parathyroid glands. This could lead to cardiac problems, diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, growth retardation, delayed puberty, bacterial infections, osteoporosis etc. The life expectancy of a Thalassaemia Major child depends on the ability to control the iron overload.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>\r\n                            How is iron overload monitored\r\n                        </Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            The most common method of monitoring iron overload is by checking the Serum Ferritin level, which is measured in terms of nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). A Serum Ferritin level of above 1000 ng/ml signifies iron overload, which is when iron chelation therapy is started. However the monitoring by Serum Ferritin levels has certain limitation with respect to its interpretation. But easy accessibility and lower costs makes this method the most common choice. Comparing the Serum Ferritin levels of a patient from one period to another gives a good indication of the changes in the iron overload.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            The best method for measuring iron levels is Liver Biopsy. Apart from being very costly, it is not preferred due to its invasive nature, which could cause internal bleeding.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            The other methods of monitoring iron overload are SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>Iron chelation</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            The process of removal of iron from the blood stream is called as ‘Iron Chelation’. This is started when the child is approximately 2 years old after checking the Serum Ferritin levels. The aim of iron chelation is to keep the Serum Ferritin levels in the range 1000 to 1500 ng/ml. The different drugs that are available for iron chelation are:\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Desferrioxamine (DFO)</Span><br />\r\n                            Desferrioxamine is a compound which binds with iron and disposes it off mainly through the stool and partly through urine. It cannot be administered orally, and is given subcutaneously by a slow infusion pump. The daily dose of 30-50 mg/kg of patient’s body weight is given daily over a period of 8 to 10 hours. DFO contributes significantly in controlling iron overload in the heart, liver and endocrine glands. DFO is better known as ‘Desferal’, the brand name under which is made available by Novartis. Desferal is time tested and therefore considered more dependable by those who can afford it. However, due to the slow, subcutaneous infusion compliance to the therapy is a problem.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Deferiprone</Span><br />\r\n                            Deferiprone is the first oral drug to be developed for iron chelation. It is better known as Kelfer - the brand name under which it is made available by CIPLA in India. The recommended dose is 50 to 100 mg/kg of patient’s body weight. Kelfer has been known to work better with iron overload in the heart. However some children show symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, diarrhoea and joint pains. Patients using this therapy must get blood tests and physical examination of joints done regularly.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>ICL 670</Span><br />\r\n                            ICL 670 is the latest oral chelator to be developed. It is known to be twice as efficacious as Desferal. Initially introduced by NOVARTIS in Europe as ‘Exjade’ and later in India as ‘Asunra’, the drug is now also made available by CIPLA as ‘Desirox’. The excretion of iron is mainly through faecal matter. The maximum dose recommended is 30 mg/kg of patient’s body weight.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Initially Desferal seemed to be the only option available. The compliance problem and the prohibitive cost seemed to be the hurdle in its use. Kelfer was increasingly used in India due to ease of administering and low cost. However after studies indicated that Kelfer worked better than Desferal with respect to removal of cardiac iron overload, doctors started suggesting a combination therapy of Desferal and Kelfer. With reports of successful trials many patients would like to watch its efficacy on Indian patients before switching over to Asunra or Desirox. It is believed that over time, ICL 670 (either Asunra or Desirox) will become the preferred iron chelator.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Heading id='cure'>Cure</Heading>\r\n                        <Subheading>Stem cell transplant</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            Thalassaemia Major is caused by genetic mutations resulting in the reduced or non-production of Beta Chains. As a result globin synthesis does not take place resulting in premature destruction of Red Blood Cells.\r\n                            Production of R.B.C.s takes place in the Bone Marrow. Unfortunately, the Bone Marrow of a Thalassaemia Major child produces R.B.C’s, which die prematurely. The permanent cure, therefore would involve the ability to produce RBCs.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Stem Cells are the parent bone marrow cells of the human body. They have the ability to become different types of blood cells like RBCs, WBCs and Platelets. They are typically found in three places:\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Bone Marrow<br />\r\n                            The Blood Stream<br />\r\n                            Cord Blood<br /><br />\r\n                            Transplant of stem cells from a donor to a Thalassaemia Major patient can offer a permanent cure. This transplant will be possible if the HLA (Human Leucocyte Antigen) type of the donor matches that of the recepient. One option is to search for an ‘HLA-matched’ donor from within the family. But in more than 70% of the cases this may not yield a match. It is therefore necessary to look at unrelated donors too. This will be facilitated if a registry is prepared of willing donors, whose HLA typing has been done. The chances of finding a matching donor will be higher if the donor belongs to the same ethnic group. Unfortunately patients in India have to depend on American and European Stem Cell registries, as India does not yet have a functional registry.\r\n                            <br /><br />Stem Cells Trasplantation can be effected by:<br /><br />\r\n\r\n                            <Span>Bone Marrow Transplant</Span><br />\r\n                            Bone Marrow is the spongy substance which is found inside the hollow bones of the body, and contains stem cells. The Bone Marrow donor will have to undergo a procedure in sterile conditions in a hospital. Under general anaesthesia, the bone marrow is aspirated from the back of the hip bone of the donor in the procedure which may atke up to 2 hours. The donor’s marrow is replenished within 6 weeks.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant</Span><br />\r\n                            In this procedure the donor is given injections of a growth factor for four to five consecutive days. This facilitates mobilization of stem cells from the bone marrow into the blood stream. The donor is then required to go through a process of ‘Apheresis’, which will draw blood through a vein, pass the blood through the Apheresis Machine for separation of Stem Cells, and return the remaining components to the donor. This cycle is repeated, and the entire procedure will take between 3 to 4 hours. If enough stem cells are not collected during this procedure a repetition will be required.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            <Span>Cord Blood Transplant</Span><br />\r\n                            Cord Blood is placental blood which is collected during child birth. This cord blood, which is very rich in stem cells, is collected and stored for future use. Therefore there is no question of looking for a donor. The risk of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), which exists in other Stem Cells Transplants, is much lesser in the case of Cord Blood.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            Apart from the hurdle of finding a matching donor, Stem Cell Transplant also has to contend with a huge financial cost as well as careful and extended post-operative care. These hurdles put the option of stem cell transplant outside the reach of most Indian patients.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>Stem cell registry</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            HLA-matched Stem Cells can offer a cure to thalassaemia major patients. Leukemia patients also can look forward to Stem Cells Transplant as a life saving procedure. However, it is important that the HLA factors of the patient and the donor are found to match. Relatives and close friends of patients in India today form the core registry from which to identify HLA-matched donors. This is because there exists no registry of Stem cell Donors in India. Less than 30% of the patients may find a donors from this pool. The European and American registries offer only a very, very slim chance of finding an HLA-matched donor. It is easier to find a match from a pool consisting of people from the same ethnic group.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            The Bone Marrow Registry of India (BMRI) has been established with the objective of preparing and maintaining a centralized and confidential HLA typed database of potential voluntary donors of Indian ethnic background.

Genes are present in every cell of our body. You have two of every kind of gene, one passed on by your mother, the other passed on by your father. One of these two genes tends to dominate and the other is recessive. The characteristic/function acquired by a person depends on which parent’s gene dominates. There could be some characteristic where the mother’s gene dominates, whereas in other characteristics the father’s gene may. Among many other pairs of genes, you have two genes that control how haemoglobin is made in each of your red blood cells.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            ‘Normal’ people are normal because they have two normal genes for haemoglobin. In other words, both parents have passed on normal genes for haemoglobin.<br /><br />\r\n                            Persons with Thalassaemia Minor (also called ‘carriers’) have one normal gene and one altered gene for haemoglobin. They are healthy because the normal gene becomes the dominant gene. One of the parents has passed on the altered gene. Therefore, atleast one parent is definitely a Thalassaemia Minor.<br /><br />\r\n                            People with Thalassaemia Major have two altered genes for haemoglobin. This means that both parents have passed on the altered gene. Therefore both parents have to be Thalassaemia Minor.<br /><br />\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>If one parent is Thalassaemia Minor and the other is Normal</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            If one parent in a marriage is a Thalassaemia Minor and the other is ‘Normal’:\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            The gene that comes to the child from the Normal parent will always be the ‘normal’ gene.<br />\r\n                            Tthe gene that comes from the parent who is Thalassaemia Minor could either be the ‘altered’ one or the ‘normal’ one.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            There is 50% chance that the child will be ‘Normal’ and a 50% chance that the child will be a Thalassaemia Minor.

Information should be made available to the couple at risk so as to enable them to make an informed choice. It should be made clear to them that they carry the risk of producing a Thalassaemia Major child. There is a one-in-four chance in every pregnancy of their child being a Thalassaemia Major.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            It is possible to go for a Pre Natal Test, very early in the pregnancy, and figure out if the foetus is Thalassaemia Major. An informed decision can be taken on whether to continue with the pregnancy or not. While making a decision on the Pre Natal Diagnosis, the couple at risk needs to be informed about the procedure of diagnosis, the risk of miscarriage after the procedure and the chances of misdiagnosis. The different methods for Pre Natal Diagnosis are Chorionic Villi Sampling (CVS), Amniocentesis and Foetal Blood Sampling.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>\r\n                            Chorionic Villi Sampling (CVS)\r\n                        </Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            This can be done in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the results are reliable. The developing placenta is known to have the same genetic make-up as the foetus. CVS involves collecting a sample of the developing placenta, by means of a needle inserted through the abdominal wall. The transabdominal CVS under ultrasound guidance has been routinely performed form gestation of 6 weeks until the third trimester.\r\n                            <br /><br />\r\n                            The advantages of CVS are reliable results, quicker results and early detection. This also means lesser emotional stress due to earlier decision if termination of pregnancy is required.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>Amniocentesis</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            This is conventionally done from 16 weeks’ gestation onwards. The amniotic fluid surrounds the foetus in the amniotic cavity. In amniocentesis 15-20 ml of the amniotic fluid is withdrawn by inserting a needle into the abdomen under ultrasound guidance. Late diagnosis is the major disadvantage of this method, particularly so when the foetus is affected and termination of pregnancy is sought.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Subheading>Foetal Blood Sampling</Subheading>\r\n                        <Paragraph>\r\n                            This can be carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The procedure involves inserting a needle under ultrasound guidance through the abdominal wall and collecting a sample of foetal blood from the umbilical cord.\r\n                        </Paragraph>\r\n                        <Heading id='thal-minor'>If you are Thal.

And this can happen only if your spouse is also a Thalassaemia Minor. If your spouse is also a Thalassaemia Minor, there is a one-in-four (25 %) chance in each pregnancy that the child born to you will be a Thalassaemia Major.

Ask them to do a Blood Test and confirm whether they are Thalassaemia Minor or not.
