                        Most people think Thalassaemia is about a child who needs lifelong blood transfusions. While this is true, Thalassaemia more importantly is about two healthy youngsters who did not know that they were Thalassaemia Minor.
                        <br /><br />
                        A Thalassaemia Major child is born only if both parents are Thalassaemia Minor. The parents do not know that they are Thalassaemia Minor because most Thalassaemia Minors are normal, healthy people. They will continue to be healthy.
                        <br /><br />
                        There are an estimated 40 million Indians who are Thalassaemia Minor. Almost all of them are completely unawares of this. There are only two ways of finding out if you are a Thalassaemia Minor :
                        by doing a blood test for Thalassaemia Minor or
                        after giving birth to a Thalassaemia Major child.
                        <br /><br />
                        Unfortunately most people come to know that they are Thalassaemia Minor only after the birth of their Thalassaemia Major child. By then the harm is done and they can only repent. Had they known that they were both Thalassaemia Minor, they could have prevented this birth.
                        <br /><br />
                        It is important for every youngster to do a test for Thalassaemia Minor.

                        <Paragraph>
                            If one looks at the life story of every family having a Thalassaemia Major child, there is a clear similarity. Both parents are healthy individuals and have had a normal transition from childhood to adulthood. They go through the natural process of marriage and giving birth to a child. The child is diagnosed to be a Thalassaemia Major between 3 to 6 months of age. The Doctor tells them that the child will need lifelong blood transfusions for survival, which comes as a rude shock to them. They are then told that the child is a Thalassaemia Major only because both of them are Thalassaemia Minor.
                            <br /><br />
                            Thalassaemia Minors are normal, healthy individuals. In most cases they do not know that they are Thalassaemia Minor. In India, there are an estimated 40 million persons who are Thalassaemia Minor. It is important for every youngster to do a blood test for Thalassaemia Minor. Knowing that one is a Thalassaemia Minor could be the most important revelation of one’s life.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Subheading>Thal. Minor is a genetic status</Subheading>
                        <Paragraph>
                            Every physical characteristic and function of the human body is controlled by a pair of genes. Genes are present in every cell of our body. You have two of every kind of gene, one passed on by your mother, the other passed on by your father. One of these two genes tends to dominate and the other is recessive. The characteristic/function acquired by a person depends on which parent’s gene dominates. There could be some characteristic where the mother’s gene dominates, whereas in other characteristics the father’s gene may. Among many other pairs of genes, you have two genes that control how haemoglobin is made in each of your red blood cells.
                            <br /><br />
                            ‘Normal’ people are normal because they have two normal genes for haemoglobin. In other words, both parents have passed on normal genes for haemoglobin.<br /><br />
                            Persons with Thalassaemia Minor (also called ‘carriers’) have one normal gene and one altered gene for haemoglobin. They are healthy because the normal gene becomes the dominant gene. One of the parents has passed on the altered gene. Therefore, atleast one parent is definitely a Thalassaemia Minor.<br /><br />
                            People with Thalassaemia Major have two altered genes for haemoglobin. This means that both parents have passed on the altered gene. Therefore both parents have to be Thalassaemia Minor.<br /><br />
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Subheading>If one parent is Thalassaemia Minor and the other is Normal</Subheading>
                        <Paragraph>
                            If one parent in a marriage is a Thalassaemia Minor and the other is ‘Normal’:
                            <br /><br />
                            The gene that comes to the child from the Normal parent will always be the ‘normal’ gene.<br />
                            Tthe gene that comes from the parent who is Thalassaemia Minor could either be the ‘altered’ one or the ‘normal’ one.
                            <br /><br />
                            There is 50% chance that the child will be ‘Normal’ and a 50% chance that the child will be a Thalassaemia Minor. In both cases the child can be expected to lead a normal healthy life.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Subheading>If both parents are Thalassaemia Minor</Subheading>
                        <Paragraph>
                            If both partners in a marriage are Thalassaemia Minor, there are the following possibilities:
                            <br /><br />
                            Both mother and father pass on the normal gene – child is ‘normal’.<br />
                            Mother passes on the normal gene and father passes on the altered gene – child is a Thalassaemia Minor.<br />
                            Mother passes on the altered gene and father passes on the normal gene – child is a Thalassaemia Minor.<br />
                            Both mother and father pass on the altered gene – child is Thalassaemia major (serious problem).<br />
                            Thus a Thalassaemia Major child is born only if both the mother and the father are Thalassaemia Minor.<br />
                        </Paragraph>

                            Every healthy youngster must do a blood test for Thalassaemia Minor<br /><br />
                            If one is a Thalassaemia Minor one must get the spouse/future spouse also tested.<br />
                            If both partners in a marriage are Thalassaemia Minor, there is a 25% chance in every pregnancy that their child will be a Thalassaemia Major.<br />
                            If both partners are Thalassaemia Minor and desire a child, a Pre Natal Test very early in the pregnancy will determine if the foetus is affected or not.<br />

                            The birth of a Thalassaemia Major child always points to two healthy youngsters the parents) who were completely unaware of being Thalassaemia Minor. Being healthy individuals, Thalassaemia Minors are completely unaware of the danger that lurks. The challenge in the fight against Thalassaemia is in getting healthy youngsters to think that a test for Thalassaemia Minor is important for them.

                        <Subheading>Awareness Exercise</Subheading>
                        <Paragraph>
                            Creating a message in a manner that is interesting to youngsters is the main challenge. This message should stand out in the clutter of information that the general public is deluged with. This awareness exercise can be carried out by:
                            <br /><br />
                            making a short film (30 - 60 seconds) on Thalassaemia, which can be telecast. This will ensure that the message reaches out to a very wide audience.
                            making a documentary film, which can be shown in theatres and locations identified for screening camps.
                            making a Power Point Presentation to be presented to corporates and others.
                            designing and printing Posters for distribution to colleges, corporates, residential areas, railway stations, other public places.
                            introducing Thalassaemia as a chapter for 9th/10th standard students.
                            incorporating a session on Thalassaemia in Pre-Marital Counseling sessions.
                            carrying information on Thalassaemia in matrimonial websites.
                            incorporating a Pre-printed remark on the CBC Report given by laboratories.

                            The awareness exercise has to be followed up with Screening Camps, which will provide a convenient facility for those interested in doing the test. These Screening Camps need to be organized at different levels :
                            <br /><br />
                            <Span>In schools :</Span> The test may be done for students of 9th/10th standard after taking permission of their parents.<br />
                            <Span>In colleges :</Span> There could be structured programme for testing all final year students of colleges.<br />
                            <Span>In corporates :</Span> This could be done with special emphasis to industries, which have a large number of young employees. Corporates could also be requested to include a test for Thalassaemia minor in the medical tests to be done by a new recruit.<br />
                            <Span>In residential areas :</Span> One could target the residential areas having a higher population of the high-risk communities.<br />
                            <Span>In community-based organizations :</Span> Those communities that are identified as high risk may be targeted through their community leaders and organizations.<br />
                            <Span>In gynaecological clinics :</Span> This will not involve conducting camps, but sensitizing gynaecologists to ensure that expectant mothers are screened, and necessary follow up is carried out.<br />
                            <Span>In pathology laboratories :</Span> Almost everyone undergoes a test for Complete Blood Count at some stage in life. If Laboratories carry a Pre-printed Remark that ‘ If MVC lesse than 80; MCH is less than 27, would be advised to go for a test to rule out Iron Deficiency Anaemia or Thalassaemia Minor’; many persons would screen themselves for Thalassaemia Minor.<br />

                        <Heading id='pre-natal-diagnosis'>Pre Natal Diagnosis</Heading>
                        <Paragraph>
                            In the event of both partners in a marriage being Thalassaemia Minor, genetic counseling should be provided by a trained counselor. Information should be made available to the couple at risk so as to enable them to make an informed choice. It should be made clear to them that they carry the risk of producing a Thalassaemia Major child. There is a one-in-four chance in every pregnancy of their child being a Thalassaemia Major.
                            <br /><br />
                            It is possible to go for a Pre Natal Test, very early in the pregnancy, and figure out if the foetus is Thalassaemia Major. An informed decision can be taken on whether to continue with the pregnancy or not. While making a decision on the Pre Natal Diagnosis, the couple at risk needs to be informed about the procedure of diagnosis, the risk of miscarriage after the procedure and the chances of misdiagnosis. The different methods for Pre Natal Diagnosis are Chorionic Villi Sampling (CVS), Amniocentesis and Foetal Blood Sampling.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Subheading>
                            Chorionic Villi Sampling (CVS)
                        </Subheading>
                        <Paragraph>
                            This can be done in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the results are reliable. The developing placenta is known to have the same genetic make-up as the foetus. CVS involves collecting a sample of the developing placenta, by means of a needle inserted through the abdominal wall. The transabdominal CVS under ultrasound guidance has been routinely performed form gestation of 6 weeks until the third trimester.
                            <br /><br />
                            The advantages of CVS are reliable results, quicker results and early detection. This also means lesser emotional stress due to earlier decision if termination of pregnancy is required.

                        <Paragraph>
                            This is conventionally done from 16 weeks’ gestation onwards. The amniotic fluid surrounds the foetus in the amniotic cavity. In amniocentesis 15-20 ml of the amniotic fluid is withdrawn by inserting a needle into the abdomen under ultrasound guidance. Late diagnosis is the major disadvantage of this method, particularly so when the foetus is affected and termination of pregnancy is sought.

                            This can be carried out after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The procedure involves inserting a needle under ultrasound guidance through the abdominal wall and collecting a sample of foetal blood from the umbilical cord.

                        <Paragraph>
                            As a Thalassaemia Minor, you carry the risk of giving birth to a child who is a Thalassaemia Major. And this can happen only if your spouse is also a Thalassaemia Minor. If your spouse is also a Thalassaemia Minor, there is a one-in-four (25 %) chance in each pregnancy that the child born to you will be a Thalassaemia Major. In this case you would be in for serious trouble. A Thalassaemia Major child needs regular blood transfusions throughout life for survival.
                            <br /><br />
                            Therefore, you must find out if your spouse is also a Thalassaemia Minor by asking your spouse to do a Blood Test. If your spouse is not a Thalassaemia Minor, there is nothing to worry for you.
                            <br /><br />
                            But if your spouse is a Thalassaemia Minor like you, your options are:<br /><br />
                            not to have a child (you may adopt a child).<br />
                            have your own biological child, but only after doing a Pre Natal Test very early in the pregnancy and knowing whether the foetus is Thalassaemia Major or not. If the foetus is Thalassaemia Major, you have the option of termination of pregnancy.<br />
                            <br /><br />
                            Remember, a Thalassaemia Major child is born only if both parents are Thalassaemia Minor.

                            As a Thalassaemia Minor you must realize that there is a good chance that your brothers, sisters and cousins are also Thalassaemia Minor. Ask them to do a Blood Test and confirm whether they are Thalassaemia Minor or not. And if they are, they should take the same precaution that has been advised to you.
                        </Paragraph>

                            When there is a drop in the haemoglobin count there is a tendency to administer iron supplements or iron tonics or iron tablets. This may not work with a Thalassaemia Minor. Therefore, if your haemoglobin drops, you must inform your doctor that you are a Thalassaemia Minor. The doctor will then suitably advise you.
